TrackIT Team,

The slowness of navigating has been bugging me for a while and discovered that the left menu was causing a whole lot of of the slow-down, so I acted on it.

I moved the links into a "Dashboard" view that currently only consists of links. It will eventually have summarized information, graphs, charts, etc.

The links below the project links have been moved to the "Administration" page on the top of the left menu (below Home and Wiki).

Deployment fixes:

* (possibly FIXED) When I create an issue, save, go to a different window or link and attempt to edit the issue I just created I get the following “   Issue #59726 does not exist”

* (on hold) 3. Laptops and Scanners lists: Don’t allow duplicate S/Ns (added to this list 8/23/18)

* (on hold) 7. Process for taking a FACET computer name out of circulation is very cumbersome. Have to create placeholder laptop/scanner/Kofax license records (added to this list 9/4/18)

* Optimized navigation.

Darby is out for the week which is why the High Priority Items 3 and 7 are "on hold."
