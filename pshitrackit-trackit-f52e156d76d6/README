* "C:\Java" seems to be where the website files are at, but not positive
* "C:\sqlite3_db" is where the intranet database files are. "pshi.db" is the intranet database

Intranet Architecture
* See this file for some summary info: "P:\Java-development\Java Technologies Utilized.txt". Versions listed may not be accurate, please update as you discover info and add as much useful info as you can. It would be great to have an as-built document for the intranet so that we have a visual of the architecture
* Looks like the source code is at "P:\Java-development\source"
